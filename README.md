**[Angular Material Application Template](https://onthecode.co.uk/angular-material-starter-template-for-your-next-project/)** is a free template built with Angular 8 and Angular Material 8. You can use it out of the box without having to change any file paths. Everything you need to start development on an Angular 8 project is here.

Angular Material starter template has been built with the official style guide in mind, which means it promotes a clean folder structure and separation of concerns. The material template is fully responsive and contains the fundamental building blocks of a scalable Angular application:

* Login component
* Password reset component
* Responsive Admin dashboard with sidebar
* Account area with change password component
* Log out
* All Angular Material components

In addition to Angular 8, other well-known open-source libraries such as rxjs, moment and ngx-logger are also included.

This application template came as a result of several applications that we have developed over the past few years. We have always used Angular Material components and wanted to create a starter template to save time for greenfield projects. We developed it based on user feedback and it is a powerful Angular admin dashboard, which allows you to build products like admin panels, content management systems (CMS) and customer relationship management (CRM) software.
